# BrightSummarize
Overview:

This is an iOS application for article summary, implemented with the "Text Summarization API" from Mashape. The objective-C files for the provided API have already been added to the project, thus no other dependencies need to be inserted. 
**Please note, the API service would only last for 1 month, ending on Apr 21, 2016. The author would terminate the payment for the API then.**
The deployment target is iOS 9.2, and it is tested that the app works well on iPhone 5s. Users can either enter URL to the article, or copy the article text to generate the summary, which could be copied to other platforms (email, note, chat...). The summary can also be saved in the core data, and users are allowed to modify, update and delete the summaries.

Setup:

1. Downloading the project code
2. Open BrightSummarize.xcodeproj
3. Run on simulator or iPhone connected to the computer
